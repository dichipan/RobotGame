A long-term goal for this project is to split it off into two separate projects, with one becoming a full-fledged game, and one similar to a modernized version of [NZP](https://github.com/nzp-team/nzportable) with mod tools. This is not the focus yet, but will become the focus once all mechanics are thourougly polished and implemented.
